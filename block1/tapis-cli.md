Tutorial: Getting Started with Tapis CLI
===============================================
The following instructions will guide you through setting up Tapis CLI.  As an aside, everything we do today can also be accomplished from a command line interface or by directly calling API endpoints.  

The Tapis CLI commands all respond with help for -h and return back information on the parameters that can be passed.

Initial Requirements
===============================================

Before getting started, you need to have the following:
* A TACC Account 
* SSH access to the Stampede 2 compute cluster and an allocation.
* Familiarity with [editing text files](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/v2.7/nano.html) and [working at the command line](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Introduction)

Any questions?  Join the [TACC Institute SLACK CHANNEL](https://app.slack.com/client/T015E2VMTLH/C015RUFEYBH) and ask away.


Command Line Access
===================

Open a terminal in your laptop and install Tapis CLI.

Tapis has a downloadable set of command line tools that make it easier to work with the API from the shell. Using these scripts is generally easier than hand-crafting cURL commands, but if you prefer that route, consult the [Tapis API Documentation](https://tacc-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We include these scripts in the training virtual machines and supplement them with additional support scripts, example files, and documents.

```
docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/work -v ${HOME}/.agave:/root/.agave \
      tacc/tapis-cli-ng:latest /bin/bash
```

Authentication
----------------

Tapis has robust Authentication/Authorization pathways - we could easliy spend an hour or more discussing them, but will keep our focus simple for this tutorial.

The Tapis API uses OAuth 2 for managing authentication and authorization. OAuth 2 is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.

Just understand that instead of passing a username and password every time we want to make an authenticated/authorized request to the Tapis APIs we will be usig an Access Token that has a defined expiration - this keeps our credentials safe and ensures that if someone where to obtain the token it could not be used forever.

Run the following in the CLI
```
>auth-check
Please run /agave-cli/bin/tenants-init to initialize your client before attempting to interact with the APIs.
```
We will see that we have to initialize some things before we can use Tapis.

Initialize the CLI
------------------

The first time you install the CLI tools on a computer, you need to initialize it.
You can initialize the TACC tenant by runnning:

```
> auth-session-init
ID                   NAME                                     URL

Please specify the ID for the tenant you wish to interact with: tacc.prod
Creating a client...
API username: train100
API password:
Created client 5c8c91edb474 - Autogenerated client
Getting oauth bearer tokens...
```
Select the 'tacc.prod' tenant and then use the username and password provided for this tutorial.

The 'auth-session-init' command creates a Tapis client and then request an API token and will then place the TACC tenant,client and API token information into a cache in ~/.agave/current. This is the file that the CLI tools will look for when making API calls so that you don't have to enter those parameters for every call.


Creating a Client 
----------------
The Tapis API uses OAuth 2 for managing authentication and authorization. Before you work with Tapis, you must create an OAuth client application and record the API keys that are returned. This is a one-time action per machine that you use the CLI on and the 'auth-session-init' can take care of this.  In the event you need to create your own client you can pass additional parameters to the 'auth-session-init' command.  For instance if we want to make a new client.

```
> auth-session-init -h
usage: auth-session-init [-h] [-c CACHEDIR] [--tenants TENANTS] [-t TENANT]
                         [-u USERNAME] [-N CLIENT_NAME] [-D DESCRIPTION]

Create a new Agave oauth client

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CACHEDIR, --cachedir CACHEDIR
                        Directory to save confiurations in.
  --tenants TENANTS     URL with tenants listings.
  -t TENANT, --tenant TENANT
                        Tenant id for session.
  -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                        Session username.
  -N CLIENT_NAME, --name CLIENT_NAME
                        Name of client.
  -D DESCRIPTION, --description DESCRIPTION
                        Description of client.

> auth-session-init -N myclient1
Client 'myclient1' is not saved in /root/.agave, so we will create it...
Creating a client...
API password:
Created client myclient1 - Autogenerated client
Getting oauth bearer tokens...
API password:
```

*Note:* The -N flag allows you to specify a machine-readable name for your client and -D provides the description. 

You will need access to the ```consumerKey``` and ```consumerSecret``` values when setting up on other hosts. So, please take a moment and record *client_name*, *consumerKey*, and *consumerSecret* somewhere safe. If you lose these values, you can create a new instance of the client by deleting the old client (clients-delete CLIENT_NAME) and creating it again (or create a new client with a different name).

 OAuth 2 API authentication token
----------------

Tokens are a form of short-lived, temporary authenticiation and authorization used in place of your username and password. To interact with Tapis, you will need to acquire one. Each Tapis token, typically, expires after 4 hours, but can easily be refreshed.

On a host where you have configured a Tapis OAuth2 client already, the CLI command to get a new token is:

```
> auth-tokens-create -v
API password:
```

You will then be prompted to enter your *API password*. **Type your user password**.  At this point, you should receive an affirmation of success in your terminal that resembles this one:

```
Token for tacc.prod:train100 successfully refreshed and cached for 13605 seconds
{
  "scope": "default",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 13605,
  "refresh_token": "fd38287337b5312933eea555555",
  "access_token": "f940624e12e7186117443ee555555"
}
```

NOTE that the CLI will cache the new access and refresh tokens in the ~/.agave/current file.

## Refreshing your token

This tutorial won't take very long, but if you are interrupted and come back later, you might find your token has expired. You can always refresh a token as follows:

```> auth-tokens-refresh -v```

A successful refresh should appear:

```
Token for tacc.prod:train100 successfully refreshed and cached for 14400 seconds
{
  "scope": "default",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 14400,
  "refresh_token": "b4b5c3e5b7c77862af8088c4a92c6a25",
  "access_token": "561335afda3b35654c84dc6d483f7ccf"
}
```

This topic is covered in great detail at the Tapis [Authorization Guide](https://tacc-cloud.readthedocs.io/projects/agave/en/latest/agave/guides/authorization/introduction.html)

NOTE that most CLI commands will attempt to do a token refresh on your behalf if the access token is expired.

## Command Help

Note that all the CLI commands take the '-h' flag to display a short description and the accept parameters for the command.


```python

```
